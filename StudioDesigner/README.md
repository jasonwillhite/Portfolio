## Studio Designer

Project that was assigned to me, which over the course of several years, was able to replace our exiting use of Adobe InDesign to design, manipulate and test graphical layouts of in-store signage.

Built to support layering, complex typographics, pdf/esp images with and without cropping, shapes and a number of expected behavior our normal users would expect to find in off-the-shelf image editors
