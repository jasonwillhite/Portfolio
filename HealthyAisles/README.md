## HealthyAisles

Nutrition image repository manager, used to upload, quality control, compare and manage
studio shots of images.

Written in Silverlight, using a plugin style view-loader, this communicated with
several WCF services; used a map-based control to pinpoint stores and items; and handled
multiple user sessions with locking style data management.
